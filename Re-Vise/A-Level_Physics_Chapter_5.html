<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Topic 5.1: Thermal physics</strong></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">Temperature</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Temperature is a number used to indicate the <strong>level of hotness </strong>of an object on some scale. The</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Celsius scale </strong>is commonly used to measure temperature. It marks the melting point of pure ice as 0&deg;C, and the boiling point of water as 100&deg;C, under atmospheric pressure. The</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>thermodynamic scale </strong>of temperature uses the triple point of pure water, 273.16K and absolute 0 as its fixed points, and it is measured in <strong>kelvin</strong>. A temperature increase of 1 kelvin is equal to an increase of 1 Celsius, but the 0 point is absolute 0, so T(K) = T(&deg;C) + 273.16</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Thermal equilibrium</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">If two substances are in contact, and one is hotter than the other, then there will be a <strong>net flow </strong>of thermal energy from the hotter object to the cooler object. The hotter object will cool down and the cooler one will warm up, until they are at the same temperature, where there will be no net energy transfer. Two objects are in <strong>thermal equilibrium </strong>when there is no net transfer of thermal energy between them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>The kinetic model</u></span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">Solids, liquids, and gases</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In <strong>solids</strong>, atoms are closely packed together. There are <strong>strong electrostatic forces of attraction </strong>between molecules, and the molecules also have negative electrostatic potential energy (negative because external energy is required to separate the molecules). The molecules have kinetic energy, which allows them to <strong>vibrate around their fixed positions</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In the <strong>liquid </strong>phase, the molecules are still have a <strong>greater mean separation </strong>than in solids, but are still close together. They have more kinetic energy, so they can move around. There is still electrostatic attraction, but it is weaker than in solids. The negative electrostatic potential energy value is greater (less negative).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In the <strong>gaseous </strong>phase, the molecules have the most kinetic energy, allowing them to move freely and rapidly, and collide elastically with each other. These collisions result in the molecules travelling with <strong>random speed and direction</strong>. The electrostatic attraction between molecules is negligible, and the electrostatic potential energy is at a maximum, of 0J.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Brownian motion</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The molecules of a gas travel in random directions with random velocity. This is called <strong>Brownian motion</strong>, and can be seen by looking at smoke particles in air. The smoke particles are visible under a microscope, and exhibit random motion because of their collisions with the molecules in air, which result in a transfer of momentum in random ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Internal energy</u></span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">Internal energy</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The <strong>internal energy </strong>of a substance is defined as the sum of the randomly distributed kinetic and potential energies associated with the atoms or molecules which make up the substance. When a substance is heated, but remains in the same state, the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, but the potential energy remains the same. When a substance changes state (from solid -&gt; liquid</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">-&gt; gas) the potential energy increases, but the kinetic energy remains the same. The temperature of the substance will also stay the same whilst it changes phase, because the thermal energy is being used to <strong>overcome electrostatic bonds </strong>between molecules.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Absolute zero</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Absolute zero is 0K, and is the point where all molecules in a substance <strong>stop moving completely</strong>. This is also where the substance has minimal internal energy. The internal energy here is entirely due to the electrostatic potential energy, as the molecules do not have any kinetic energy.</span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">Thermal properties of materials</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Specific heat capacity</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The <strong>specific heat capacity</strong>, <em>c </em>of a substance is defined as the energy required per unit mass to increase the temperature by 1K. The specific heat capacity is given by the equation</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">𝐸𝐸 = 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚∆𝜃𝜃</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">where <em>E </em>is the energy supplied to the substance, <em>m </em>is the mass of the substance, and <em>∆&theta; </em>is the change in temperature of the substance. It has the units Jkg<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The <strong>method of mixtures </strong>can be used to determine specific heat capacity. Known masses of two substance at different known temperatures are mixed together until they reach <strong>thermal equilibrium</strong>, at which point the final temperature is measured. The energy transfer from the hotter substance is the same as the energy transfer to the cooler substance, so the equation</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">𝐸𝐸 = 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚∆𝜃𝜃 can be equated for both substances. If the specific heat capacity of one of the substances is known, then it can be determine for the other substance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The specific heat capacity of a substance can be calculated more accurately by using an <strong>electrical heater </strong>to heat a substance. A known mass of a substance is heated by an electrical heater with known power (or measured p.d. and current) for a given time. The initial and final temperatures of the substance are measured. As energy transfer is equal to power (VI) multiplies</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">by time, we can use the equation 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 = <u>𝑚𝑚𝑚</u><u>𝑚</u><u>∆</u><u>𝜃𝜃</u>, and rearrange to find <em>c</em>. An <strong>insulator </strong>is used around</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">𝑡𝑡</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">the substance to minimise external energy transfer, increasing accuracy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Specific latent heat</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Energy is required in order for a substance to <strong>change phase</strong>. The specific latent heat of fusion, Lf, is the energy required per unit mass to change the phase of a substance from <strong>solid to liquid</strong>. The specific latent heat of vaporisation, Lv, is the energy required per unit mass to change the phase of a substance from <strong>liquid to gas</strong>. The formula</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em>E = mL</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">can be used to determine specific latent heat, L, where E is the energy required to change the phase of a substance of mass m. The units for L are Jkg<sup>-1</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The specific latent heat of a substance can be determined using a similar set-up to the experiment for specific heat capacity. An electrical heater with known power heats the object. When an object is changing phase, the temperature remains constant, so the temperature is monitored and the duration where the <strong>temperature is constant </strong>is used as the time when calculating the energy transferred to the substance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Amount of substance</u></span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">Kinetic theory of gases</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The amount of a substance can be measured in the SI base unit of the <strong>mole</strong>. One mole is the amount of substance containing 6.02&times;10<sup>23</sup> particles (atoms or molecules). This value is <strong>Avogadro&rsquo;s constant</strong>. The number of particles in a substance can be determined by multiplying the number of moles of the substance by Avogadro&rsquo;s constant. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>The kinetic theory of gases</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The kinetic theory of gases is a model which can be used to describe how particles within in</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>ideal gas </strong>behave. Certain assumptions are made in order to model a gas as an ideal gas.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">The gas contains a large number of atoms which move with random, rapid</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">The volume of the gas atoms is negligible when compared to the total volume of the</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">All collisions between atoms, with other atoms and with the walls of the container they are in, are perfectly</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">The time taken for atoms to collide is negligible compared to the time between</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">The electrostatic forces between atoms are negligible, except for when the atoms are&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Pressure</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The kinetic theory of gases can be used to understand how gas in a container produces <strong>pressure</strong>. As the collisions between atoms and the wall of the container are <strong>perfectly elastic</strong>, the atoms rebound from the wall at the same speed they travel in at. This makes their change in momentum, p, (given by p = m(v-u)) equal to 2mv. As the change in momentum is equal to force</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">multiplied by time, the average force exerted on the atom by the wall is given by 𝐹𝐹 = &nbsp;2𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">𝑡𝑡</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Using Newton&rsquo;s third law, the atom also exerts an equal and opposite force on the wall of the container. The total pressure on the wall is equal to the sum of the force of each collision between atoms in the gas and the wall, and the area of the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Ideal gas laws</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">There are two ideal gas laws which can be used to derive the equation of state for ideal gases. <strong>Boyle&rsquo;s law </strong>states that <em>for a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature, the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume. </em><strong>Charles&rsquo; law </strong>states that <em>for a fixed mass of gas at a constant volume,</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">where <em>p </em>is the pressure of the gas (Pa), <em>V </em>is the volume the gas is contained in (m<sup>3</sup>), <em>n </em>is the number of moles of gas (mol), <em>R </em>is the molar gas constant (8.31 Jmol<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>), and <em>T </em>is the temperature of the gas (Kelvin).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Investigating Boyle&rsquo;s law</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Boyle&rsquo;s law states that the pressure exerted by a fixed amount of gas is inversely proportional to its volume at a constant temperature. To investigate this experimentally, a <strong>sealed syringe </strong>can be filled with gas and connected to a <strong>pressure gauge</strong>. The syringe can be used to vary the volume of the container, and the values for volume and pressure recorded. When a graph of pressure against 1/volume is plotted, a <strong>straight line </strong>should be produced, showing a constant relationship. To increase accuracy in this experiment, the syringe should be lowered <strong>slowly </strong>so that no heat is produced from friction.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Estimating absolute zero using gas</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">To determine the value of absolute zero in &deg;C, a <strong>sealed container </strong>of air, connected to a pressure gauge, is placed in a water bath. The temperature of the water is varied, and the values of</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">temperature and pressure and recorded. When pressure is plotted against temperature, a linear graph will be produced. At absolute zero, the gas molecules will have <strong>no kinetic energy</strong>, so there will be no collisions with the container walls, resulting in there being no gas pressure. By extrapolating the graph back the <strong>x intercept </strong>can be found, and this is equal to absolute 0.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">Root mean square speed</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The pressure exerted by a gas, and the mean kinetic energy of molecules in the gas, are related to the <strong>root mean squar</strong>e (r.m.s.) speed of the molecules. The root mean square speed, <em>c</em>, is determined by summing the square of all of the individual velocities of molecules, dividing by the number of molecules, N, and then finding the square root of this value.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The root mean square speed can be used to find the <strong>pressure </strong>of a gas at the microscopic level</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Particles in a gas move with random velocities, in random directions. This means some of the molecules are moving very fast, whilst other molecules are barely moving at all. <strong>The Maxwell- Boltzmann distribution </strong>shows the number of molecules with each speed, against speed <em>c</em>. The area under the graph represents the total number of molecules. As the temperature of the gas increases,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">the peak of the graph shifts to a <strong>higher speed</strong>, and the distribution becomes <strong>more spread out</strong>. <u>The Boltzmann constant</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The <strong>Boltzmann constant </strong>(<em>k</em>) is equal to the molar gas constant (<em>R</em>), divided by Avogadro&rsquo;s Constant (<em>N</em><em>A</em>). Its value is 1.38x10<sup>-23</sup> JK<sup>-1</sup>. It can be used derive a second equation for the state of an ideal gas. The equation pV = nRT can be written as</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">pV = NKT</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">because <em>n</em>, the number of moles, is equal to N, the number of molecules, divided by Avogadro&rsquo;s constant. As <em>k </em>= <em>R/N</em><em>A</em>, we can then write this equation as</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">𝑝𝑝𝑉𝑉 = 𝑁𝑁𝑘𝑘𝑛𝑛</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Mean kinetic energy and temperature</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The <strong>kinetic energy </strong>of gas molecules in an ideal gas is proportional to the <strong>temperature </strong>(which must be measured in kelvin). At a given temperature, every gas molecule has the same mean kinetic energy, so more massive molecules have lower r.m.s. speeds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Internal energy of an ideal gas</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The internal energy of an ideal gas is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. Since we assume there are no electrostatic forces between molecules in an ideal gas, there is <strong>no potential energy</strong>. This means that for an ideal gas, the kinetic energy is equal to the total internal energy, hence the internal energy is proportional to temperature.</span></p>
		<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Circular Motion</u></span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>RADIANS</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">One radian is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc of length equal to the circle&rsquo;s radius</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Radians is a dimensionless quantity. It is a ratio of lengths, with , so its unit is metres/metres.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>CIRCULAR MOTION BASICS</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Uniform circular motion is motion in a circle where speed isn&rsquo;t changing but the direction of it, velocity, is. So velocity&rsquo;s magnitude will remain unchanged, and there is only directional acceleration.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The period T, is the time taken for one complete revolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Angular velocity is the rate of change of angle.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp; (as is takes T seconds for 2&nbsp;radians)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">However, , so therefore&nbsp; .</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">So the relationship between velocity and angular velocity is</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">To calculate a numerical change in velocity, we need to consider them as vectors. The change in the velocity is the velocity that has to be added to the original velocity to get the final velocity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Notice that the change of velocity is pointing towards the centre of the circle, and hence so is the acceleration.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration of a body moving in circular motion with constant speed, and is directed towards the centre of the circular path.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">As there is acceleration, it follows that there must be a net force causing the acceleration, which is called the centripetal force.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Centripetal force always acts towards the centre of the circle. It keeps the object moving in a circular path, and if it were not for this force it would move tangential to the circular path.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;but we know the formula for centripetal acceleration. Hence,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Centripetal force is NOT a separate force, but rather is created by the net force of other things. E.g tension in a string, friction between a road and tyres, gravitational pull on an orbit, support force from a Ferris wheel carriage. It can come in many forms, but will always be directed towards the centre of the circular path.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>ILLUSION OF CENTRIFUGAL FORCE</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">When travelling with circular motion, it is often thought that there is a force pushing the object out which keeps it in a circular path. This is not true. The object&rsquo;s mass has inertia, which is its resistance to change its motion, hence it is trying to travel in a straight line. The centripetal force, acting towards the circle centre, resists this, hence keeping it in a circular path.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The illusion of centrifugal is often felt when turning a corner in a car. You will feel yourself being &lsquo;pushed&rsquo; against the door, i.e. in the opposite direction to the centre of the circle. This is not centrifugal, but a result of centripetal. It is the reaction force exerted BY you ON the door, it affects only the door and is just a result of Newton&rsquo;s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The same applies to when objects on the dashboard will move. If the centripetal acceleration of the car is &nbsp;then the frictional force provided by the dash on the objects must be . The frictional force supplied by the dashboard may not be sufficient to accelerate these objects in the curve path.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>CENTRIPETAL EXAMPLES</u></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Ball on a flat, frictional surface, being swung around by a string. The centripetal force is provided solely by the tension.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Conical pendulum. Here the component of the tension in the string provides the centripetal force. </span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;"> hence</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">A car going around a corner.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">On a flat surface the centripetal will be supplied purely by the frictional forces by the tyre on the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">When it&rsquo;s tipped so that the centre of the circle is beneath it, then the frictional force from the tyres will have to be even greater as they have to oppose the forces from the normal reaction.</span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;"> When it&rsquo;s tipped so that the centre of the circle is towards the top of the car, the frictional forces are less because the normal force has a component in the direction of the centripetal force, hence the frictional force has to be less to keep it in motion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>NEWTON&rsquo;S LAWS WITH CENTRIPETAL</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Newton&rsquo;s laws still apply. There must be a net force to change the velocity (1<sup>st</sup> law), and this must have an equal and opposite force (3<sup>rd</sup> law). The mass orbits the Earth in circular motion due to the force of gravity. However, it also exerts an equal force on the Earth. The rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the force, hence F=kma. The Earth has a much large mass than the moon, hence the effect on the Earth is comparatively small. There is a little wobble and tides are caused, but that is it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">A field is a region in which a force operates.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">A force produced by a field is unique in that there doesn&rsquo;t have to be a connection in the system. Newton&rsquo;s Laws still apply though, in that they will both exert forces on each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Gravitational fields are infinite. They start at infinity and end at the matter.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">The field covers the whole area around Earth (the lines are just there to demonstrate strength.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">As the field lines meet Earth, they begin the fade away. At the centre they are zero.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">The field is always directed towards Earth.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">An inverse square law applies with its strength. So twice the distance has a quarter of the field strength. where F is the force of gravity.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">The field is not uniform. As the distance towards Earth&rsquo;s surface is small, the field likes become more parallel and hence the field becomes more uniform.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The gravitational field of the Earth varies at a given height due to the distribution of the Earth&rsquo;s mass. At some places there will be less dense materials, and the Earth is not perfectly spherical so r will not necessarily be the same at a given distance from Earth&rsquo;s surface.</span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;"> For example, oil deposits are denser than land and so g increases, water is less dense than rock, mountains are further away from the surface than its surrounding land is.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>The gravitational field strength at any point is the force acting per unit mass at that point.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">This definition means gravitational field strength is a vector, since force is a vector, so the direction of the field is in the same direction as the force.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Its units are therefore N kg<sup>-1</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">So if we wanted to determine the gravitational field strength on Earth&rsquo;s surface&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">We know that acceleration when acted on by weight only = 9.81ms<sup>-2</sup>. So weight = 1 x 9.81 = 9.81</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Acceleration of freefall is a result of the gravitational field strength. They are not the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>NEWTON&rsquo;S LAW OF GRAVITATION</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Newton&rsquo;s Law of Gravitation states that the gravitational force of attraction between two bodies is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Putting this into symbols:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Where F = gravitational force of attraction, r = distance between the masses, M=mass (usually of the body you want to know, as m is cancelled out in order to find this)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">G = the gravitational constant, and has a value of 6.673 x 10<sup>-11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>. It is still not known as accurately as most other fundamental constants.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The minus sign indicates that the force is an attractive one.</span><br /> </p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>FINDING THE FIELD STRENGTH OF A MASS</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Since&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for any mass falling freely</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">You can use this to find the gravitational field strength of a mass at a particular point from a body, r, of known mass, M.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>CALCULATING THE MASS OF THE SUN</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">When a body is large, the gravitational field strength will decrease to zero at its centre, but on the surface of the body it is considered to be the same as if it were a point mass. Due to planets being spherical, they can be treated like point objects at their centres provided the field in question is outside their centres.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">This force causes the orbit, i.e the force acts as a centripetal force. So . We now need Earth&rsquo;s velocity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>APPROXIMATIONS WITH GRAVITATIONAL CALCULATIONS</u></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Assume orbits are circular (in practice this is not true, they are ellipses)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Assume the Sun is stationary (not true due to the gravitational force the Earth exerts on the sun, which is of equal magnitude to that on Earth, but has a smaller effect due to the Sun&rsquo;s mass. In reality the Sun jiggles a little)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">A year is not exactly 365 days, and a day is not exactly 24 hours.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Planets are not perfectly sphere, and in reality the force of gravity will vary due to unevenly distributed mass and the fact that some parts are higher above the centre than others.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN g AND G</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">F = mg&nbsp; when considering an object in freefall, where the only force acting on it is its weight, i.e. the force of the gravitational field upon that body. Remember than the Earth can be thought of as a point mass from its centre.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">This allows g to be calculated at any height above the Earth&rsquo;s surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">If you gave a stationary object centripetal, it would just go to the path&rsquo;s centre. If you gave it a little bit of velocity, it would still fall, just further away from its starting position. If you kept increasing the velocity as it &lsquo;dropped away&rsquo; from its starting position, it would go into orbit. Its falling curve matches the curve of the Earth. At this point the centripetal force and centripetal acceleration formulas apply.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Another misconception is that of zero gravity. Astronauts in space will float around in their spaceship, not because they don&rsquo;t have gravity, but because both the spaceship and the astronaut are in freefall and are accelerating at the same rate, hence they are falling together. They are not weightless, they are constantly falling, just at the same rate as the spaceship (acceleration of freefall is independent of mass).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>KEPLER&rsquo;S THIRD LAW</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Kepler&rsquo;s Third Law states that the period of a planet squared equals the mean radius of its orbit cubed.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">So Kepler&rsquo;s law relates:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">-The average distance of a planet from the Sun&rsquo;s centre, r.</span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;"> -A planet&rsquo;s period, T, which is how long it takes to complete one orbit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">At first this was an empirical law, i.e it was made to fit figures with no theoretical basis.</span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;"> By applying Newton&rsquo;s Laws, it can be shown.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The mass of the Sun is as so much larger than any planet that it is assumed to remain stationary. For a planet moving with an orbit of radius r:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">As is a constant, it follows that .</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>SATELLITES</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">A geostationary satellite is one which appears to be stationary from a viewpoint on Earth. In other words, it orbits the Earth so that it stays in the same position with respect to the Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">So a geostationary satellite:</span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;"> - Must have its orbit centred at the centre of the Earth</span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;"> - Be travelling from west to east (this is why the sun looks as if it&rsquo;s travelling from east to west, because we travel from west to east)</span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;"> - Be over the equator (perpendicular to axis of rotation) </span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;"> - Have a period of 24 hours</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">From Kepler&rsquo;s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law formula, , we can calculate the radius needed for this orbit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Uses for geostationary satellites include: telecommunications (transmitting telephone messages around the world), television transmission, observation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The advantage of them is that no tracking system is needed, as they will always be in the same place. This means that our satellite dishes don&rsquo;t have to rotate. However, they need a fuel supply to stay in this orbit, and this will run out after ten years, and then they have to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>CIRCULAR MOTION FORMULAS<br /></u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Speed = distance/time so&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Damping</u></span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Damping is a <strong>loss of energy</strong> in oscillations. The energy will dissipate to the surroundings and the amplitude will reduce to zero. For example, a cymbal sound will eventually die away as a result of air resistance and internal losses which will reduce the effect of the restoring forces (as the cymbal distorts to produce sound) and so the oscillations, and hence sound, </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Damping &ndash;</strong> <strong>Deliberately reducing the amplitude of an oscillation</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Light Damping</strong> &ndash; <strong>Period of oscillation is almost unchanged</strong> but <strong>amplitude gradually decreases</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Critical Damping</strong> - Occurs when a system is designed to <strong>return an oscillating system to its equilibrium in the least time possible</strong>. <strong>No oscillations</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Exponential Decay </strong>&ndash; <strong>Amplitude decreases by a fixed amount in any given time</strong>. E.g. after every 1 second it has halved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Natural damping occurs everywhere. E.g. a clock&rsquo;s pendulum, which lose energy due to friction and so need a regular driving force. E.g. when people are talking, the vibrations of air molecules are quickly damped. If they weren&rsquo;t the noise would be unbearable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Damping proves very important in many industries too. E.g. <strong>concert halls</strong>. The <strong>sound needs to stay for a certain amount of time</strong>. Too short and it won&rsquo;t have a good effect, too long and it will run into too many other notes and the sound will seem fuzzy. E.g. <strong>car industries</strong>. The car becomes very <strong>noisy</strong> if its components are all vibrating, so their <strong>oscillations need to be damped</strong> as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Heavy damping examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">A test tube floating in water will bounce only a few times, but in treacle would not bounce at all.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Suspension in a car</strong>. Without the damping of the suspension, going over a bump would be a rough ride. <strong>Shock absorbers are used to critically damp </strong>so that the<strong> equilibrium </strong>is soon after established.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Resonance</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Objects which are <strong>free to vibrate</strong> will have a <strong>natural frequency</strong>, which depends on size, shape and composition. Forced vibrations occur when the object is forced to vibrate at a particular frequency by an input of force, the driving force (it&rsquo;s made to oscillate from an outside source).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>When an object is being forced to vibrate at its natural frequency, resonance will occur</strong>. The <strong>amplitude of oscillation will build up</strong> as <strong>more energy is being added</strong> to the system. The force and response of the structure are in phase with one another, so positive work is done by the force, and the energy in the vibration increases. Eventually <strong>energy supply=energy loss</strong> (to damping), and the <strong>amplitude will stabilise at a larger value</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">So resonance is when one vibrating object (driver) vibrates at the same natural frequency of a second object and so forces than object into vibrational motion. Through resonance, a comparatively weak vibration in one object can cause a strong vibration in another.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">If there is insufficient damping, the amplitude may get too large. For example, when you produce resonance with a wine glass it will shatter as it can only bend so much. There are many oscillators, so there are many natural, and hence resonant, frequencies. This can be used, or could cause damage if unknown.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">If you were to force an oscillation, this graph would occur. Resonant frequency=natural frequency.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The effect of damping on resonance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Increasing damping</strong> on resonant oscillation&hellip;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Reduces the amplitude</strong> of the driven oscillation</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Reduces the frequency</strong> of the driven oscillation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Resonance Examples</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>PLAYGROUND SWING</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">If you push a swing, you need your timing (frequency) to have a particular pattern. If you push the swing in time with the natural frequency of the swing, it will make the swing go higher and higher, giving it its maximum amplitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">However, if you don&rsquo;t keep with this timing and push as they are coming towards you, or after they have gone away from you, it will result in a smaller amplitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">This is because the energy the swing absorbs is at a maximum when the pushes are in phase with the swing&rsquo;s natural oscillations, while some of the swing&rsquo;s energy is lost when the opposing force of the pushes are not in phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>MUSIC</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Resonance is used to increase amplitude (volume) of a sound. For example, the <strong>vibrations of an organ pipe cause a column of are to vibrate in resonance</strong>, which makes it sound a lot louder. This also applies to the human voice, where the vibrations of vocal chords are reinforces by resonant vibrations in the oral and nasal passages.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>ELECTRICAL RESONANCE</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Used to <strong>tune TV and radio</strong> sets. When you tune, you are <strong>adjusting the resonant frequency of the receiver to the frequency of the transmitted signal</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>MICROWAVE OVENS</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Use resonance in a cavity in a device called a reflex klystron. Electrons travel past the cavity and create the microwaves at a frequency dependent of the cavity, similar to an organ and its pipe. Microwaves should not leak from the oven, as they could make water molecules inside humans vibrate, i.e they could cook you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>IMAGING</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Nuclei of atoms resonate when in a field of suitable magnetic oscillation</strong>, and this principle is used in magnetic resonance imaging (<strong>MRI</strong>) to obtain a very clear image.</span><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>RESONANCE DISASTERS</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">A big problem many industries face is that naturally, <strong>structures have multiple natural frequencies of oscillation</strong>, and ensuring that oscillations do not build up to a large amplitude can be hard. Usually it&rsquo;s combatted by a combination of <strong>damping</strong> and <strong>careful dimension choices</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Construction Industry:<strong> buildings and bridges</strong> mainly. Soldiers don&rsquo;t march over bridges as if the frequency matches one of <strong>the bridge&rsquo;s natural frequency, it will resonate and could collapse</strong>. <strong>Tall buildings vibrate</strong>, even in very steady wind. Some are made to be able to vibrate with an <strong>amplitude of over a metre</strong>. Buildings in <strong>seismic zones</strong> take into account the <strong>frequencies of possible ground motion</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Car Industry: Designers try to eliminate as much resonance as possible to <strong>reduce rattling and bouncing.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Aircraft Industry: A plane&rsquo;s wings bounce on take off and landing, producing nodes and antinodes. Vibration needs to be quickly damped.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Electronics: If a loudspeaker makes <strong>one or two frequencies louder than others</strong>, it&rsquo;s because <strong>the loudspeaker is resonating at those frequencies</strong>. This needs to be <strong>damped</strong> to produce <strong>good quality</strong> sound.</span></p>

<h4><a id="introduction" data-kmt="1"></a><span style="color: #ffffff;">Introduction</span></h4>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Gravity is the force that acts between any two masses, which means that you are actually attracted to all your friends, no matter how much you deny it!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Fortunately we are usually strong enough to overcome the attraction because it only becomes strong enough for us to notice its effects when the masses involved become very large e.g. planets or stars.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The force always attracts and never repels and it increases the nearer the two bodies are or the larger the masses of the bodies.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The arrows show the direction of a force on a mass placed in the field.&nbsp;<em class="red"><strong>Note:</strong></em>&nbsp;the field is not uniform (the field lines are never parallel or equi-spaced) so as you move away from the object, the strength of the field reduces.</span></p>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><span style="color: #ffffff;"><a id="gravitational-field-strength-g" style="color: #ffffff;" data-kmt="1"></a>Gravitational field strength, g</span></h4>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>A definition for gravitational fields is:</strong>&nbsp;a region in which objects with mass experience a force.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The strength of a gravitational field is defined as the force, F, acting on a unit mass, m, in the field which in an equation is:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><img src="https://www.s-cool.co.uk/assets/learn_its/alevel/physics/introduction-radial-field-and-gravitational-field-strength-g/image099.gif" alt="Copyright S-cool" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Symbol:</strong>&nbsp;g.&nbsp;<strong>Units:</strong>&nbsp;newtons per kilogram, Nkg<sup>-1</sup>, which is the same as ms<sup>-2</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em class="red"><strong>Uniform field</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In a uniform field, g will remain constant. You can consider the Earth's gravitational field to be uniform as long as you don't move more than a few kilometres above the surface of the Earth. On the surface of the Earth, g = 9.81Nkg<sup>-1</sup>, of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em class="red"><strong>Radial Field</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">It is clear looking at the diagram of field lines in the section above that the field varies as you move away from the object at its centre. In a radial field, the field strength reduces as you move away from the centre.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Newton was the first person to fully explain gravitational fields. He came up with the following equation for field strength in a radial field:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><img src="https://www.s-cool.co.uk/assets/learn_its/alevel/physics/introduction-radial-field-and-gravitational-field-strength-g/image101.gif" alt="Copyright S-cool" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em class="red"><strong>where</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>g</strong>&nbsp;= field strength at a point</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>G</strong>&nbsp;= the universal gravitational constant, value 6.7 x 10<sup>-11</sup>&nbsp;Nkg<sup>-2</sup>m<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>m</strong>&nbsp;= the mass of the object which causes the field</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>r</strong>&nbsp;= the separation between that point and the centre if the object causing the field.</span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;"><img src="https://www.s-cool.co.uk/assets/learn_its/alevel/physics/introduction-radial-field-and-gravitational-field-strength-g/a-phy-gragra-dia02.gif" alt="Gravitational Fields and Forces" /></span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em class="red"><strong>Note:</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">g &prop; mass. So increase the mass and you increase the strength of the gravitational field.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><img src="https://www.s-cool.co.uk/assets/learn_its/alevel/physics/introduction-radial-field-and-gravitational-field-strength-g/image107.gif" alt="Copyright S-cool" />. So increase the distance from the mass at the centre of the field and the field strength reduces. This is called an inverse square law as field strength is proportional to the inverse of the square of the separation of the masses. (For example if you go twice as far from a mass, its gravitational field is &frac14; as strong).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em class="red"><strong>Note:</strong></em>&nbsp;r is taken from the centre of gravity of the object, the point at which all the mass&nbsp;<em><strong>seems</strong></em>&nbsp;to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Some facts about 'g'</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">g is a&nbsp;<strong>vector</strong>. It has direction as shown in the field shape diagram above.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">g is a property of the position in a field. That means that it is the same whether or not there is an object at that point in the field.</span></p>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><span style="color: #ffffff;"><a id="force-in-a-gravitational-field" style="color: #ffffff;" data-kmt="1"></a>Force in a gravitational Field</span></h4>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">If the field strength at a point in a field is the force per unit mass, it doesn't take a huge leap to realise that the total force acting on an object of mass, M, in a gravitational field will be</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">F = M.g</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Apply that to the equation for field strength in a radial field to get:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><img src="https://www.s-cool.co.uk/assets/learn_its/alevel/physics/forces-in-a-gravitational-fields/image111.gif" alt="Copyright S-cool" />&nbsp;<img src="https://www.s-cool.co.uk/assets/learn_its/alevel/physics/forces-in-a-gravitational-fields/a-phy-gragra-dia03.gif" alt="Forces in a gravitational Fields" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em class="red"><strong>Note:</strong></em>&nbsp;that all the points made about the field strength equation are just as valid about the force equation. It is a vector, it's an inverse square relationship, it depends on the masses involved, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">However, force is not a property of the field. It depends on what is inside the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">We have come across&nbsp;<strong>potential energy</strong>&nbsp;in gravitational fields ever since GCSE. The higher you lift an object the more potential energy it has because the more work you had to do to put it there. Simple!! We even know an equation for it:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>E<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;= mgh</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Now we have to consider a couple of problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">First, in radial fields, g varies. So we can now longer use the above equation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Secondly, we need to think about&nbsp;<strong>where E<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;is zero.</strong>&nbsp;To answer this, read on!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>What causes objects to have potential energy?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Objects in a gravitational field have the potential to do work if they have a force acting on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Do objects on the Earth's surface have zero potential energy?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">No - they definitely have a force on them because they don't drift away so they have the potential to do work. In fact, push them into a hole and you will see some of that energy being converted into kinetic energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Where is the gravitational force between objects zero?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The force between objects due to gravity reduces as the distance separating the objects increases. So the force finally becomes zero at infinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Going back to our GCSE ideas, at the greatest possible distance from Earth, you should have your greatest possible value of E<sub>p</sub>. But at infinity, the attraction due to g-field is&nbsp;<strong>zero</strong>. No force &rarr; no potential energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">So the greatest E<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;value you can get is&nbsp;<strong>zero!!!!</strong>&nbsp;And you get it at infinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">When you move back towards Earth from infinity, your E<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;reduces. So it must become less than zero! It must become&nbsp;<strong>negative.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Now that's confusing! The good news is, you don't have to know exactly where infinity is to answer any questions. That's because:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">We are often only interested in the change in potential energy rather than the actual value.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Someone very thoughtfully came up with a way of calculating the potential energy that an object has by looking at the separation between the object and the centre of the field, rather than infinity. (Read on for the equation.)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Rather than talking about gravitational potential energy all the time, it is useful for a number of reasons to define a new quantity -&nbsp;<strong>Gravitational Potential, &Phi;.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">It is a very simple idea.&nbsp;<strong>Gravitational potential is the potential energy per kilogram at a point in a field.</strong>&nbsp;So the units are Jkg<sup>-1</sup>, joules per kilogram.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>The equation for potential is:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><img src="https://www.s-cool.co.uk/assets/learn_its/alevel/physics/gravitational-potential-energy/gravitational-potential/image118.gif" alt="Copyright S-cool" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em class="red"><strong>where</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>G</strong>&nbsp;= the universal gravitational constant</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>m</strong>&nbsp;= the mass causing the field</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>r</strong>&nbsp;= the distance between the centre of the mass causing the field and the point you are considering.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em class="red"><strong>Note that:</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Just like potential energy, the biggest value of potential you can get is zero. All other values are less than zero - i.e. negative!!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Potential is not a vector even though it has a negative sign. It doesn't have a direction, only a magnitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The&nbsp;<strong>potential</strong>&nbsp;(Ep per kg) at the surface of the Earth is</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">- 63 MJ kg&nbsp;<sup>-1</sup></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Do 10 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;of work on raising an object from the Earth's surface and it will move up to a point where it's&nbsp;<strong>potential</strong>&nbsp;is - 53MJ kg<sup>-1</sup>. That's 10 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;greater than on the surface because it is 10MJ kg<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;closer to zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Confusing! Look at the following diagram. It shows how potential drops as you move further from the surface of the Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">So we can define potential as "<strong>the work done per kg by an object when it moves from infinity to a point in a field</strong>".</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Looking back at the example above, that means that if you let 1kg drop from infinity to the surface of the Earth it will lose 63MJ of potential energy. Ignore air resistance, and the object will have that much kinetic energy when it hits the surface of the planet.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">To escape completely from the Earth's gravitational field you need to give an object 63MJ of kinetic energy per kg. (As it rises from the Earth it will lose kinetic energy and gain potential energy)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">This allows you to calculate an object's escape velocity - how fast you would have to throw it to get it completely out of the Earth's gravity field.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">If it needs 63MJkg<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;energy then it must start off with all this energy as Ek.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>So:</strong></span></p>

<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">Stars</span></h1>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Planets &ndash; objects with mass sufficient for their own gravity to force them to take a <strong>spherical </strong>shape, where <strong>no nuclear fusion </strong>occurs, and the object has <strong>cleared its orbit </strong>of other</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Dwarf planets &ndash; planets where the <strong>orbit has not been cleared </strong>of other</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Planetary satellites &ndash; bodies that orbit a</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Asteroids &ndash; objects which are too <strong>small and uneven </strong>in shape to be planets, with a near circular orbit around the</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Comets &ndash; small, <strong>irregularly sized </strong>balls of rock, dust, and ice. They orbit the sun in</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>eccentric elliptical </strong>orbits.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Solar systems &ndash; the systems containing stars and orbiting objects like</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Galaxies &ndash; a collection of stars, dust, and gas. Each galaxy contains around 100 billion</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Formation of stars</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Nebulae </strong>are gigantic clouds of dust and gas, and are the birthplace of all stars. Over millions of years, the <strong>gravitational attraction </strong>between dust and gas particles pulls them together to form clouds. As they come closer together, the gravitational collapse accelerates, and some regions become <strong>denser </strong>and pull in more dust and gas. The gravitational energy of the particles is converted to thermal energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The resultant sphere of very hot, dense dust and gas is a <strong>protostar</strong>. For a star to form, the temperature and pressure must be high enough for hydrogen gas nuclei in the protostar to <strong>overcome </strong>the <strong>electrostatic forces of repulsion </strong>and undergo <strong>nuclear fusion</strong>. This nuclear fusion produces helium nuclei, producing a star.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Initially, the star remains in <strong>stable equilibrium</strong>. The gravitational forces of the particles act to compress the star, but radiation pressure from photons emitted in fusion and gas pressure from nuclei in the core counteract this, keeping the size of the star almost constant. This equilibrium is known as the <strong>main phase </strong>of the star. Larger stars are hotter, and so undergo fusion faster, using up available hydrogen nuclei more quickly. This means they have a shorter main phase than smaller stars. What happens after the main phase depends on the <strong>mass </strong>of the <strong>star&rsquo;s core </strong>(the central region of the star where fusion occurs).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Evolution of a low mass star</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">M☉ is the solar mass = 1.99 x 10<sup>30</sup> kg. It is the mass of our sun&rsquo;s core. <strong>Low mass stars </strong>are classed as having a core mass between 0.5M☉ and 10M☉. As these stars have a smaller, cooler core, they remain in the main sequence for longer. Once the hydrogen supplies are low, the gravitational forces inwards overcome the radiation and gas pressures, so the star begins to&nbsp;<strong>collapse inwards</strong>. It evolves in to a <strong>red giant</strong>. The core of the red giant is too cool for helium to fuse, but the pressure in the outer shell is great enough for fusion to occur there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">As helium nuclei run low, the red giant evolves in to a <strong>white dwarf</strong>. The <strong>outer shells </strong>begin to drift off in to space as a <strong>planetary nebula</strong>, and the core remains as a very dense white dwarf. The white dwarf has a temperature of around 3000K, and no fusion occurs. Photons which were produced earlier in the evolution leak out, dissipating heat. As the star core collapses, <strong>electron degeneracy pressure </strong>(caused as two electrons cannot exist in the same state) prevents the core from collapsing. As long as the core mass is below 1.44M☉, then the white dwarf star is stable &ndash; this is the <strong>Chandrasekhar limit</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Evolution of a massive star</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Where a star&rsquo;s mass in is excess of 10 M☉, its evolution takes a different path. As hydrogen supplies deplete, the temperature is high enough for <strong>helium fusion </strong>in to heavier elements to take place, forming a <strong>red supergiant</strong>. The red supergiant has <strong>layers </strong>of increasingly heavy elements produced from fusion, with an <strong>inert iron core </strong>(as iron fusion does not release energy, it is unable to fuse further).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Once the iron core is produced, the star becomes <strong>unstable</strong>. A <strong>type 2 supernova </strong>occurs where there is a shockwave which ejects the materials in the outer shells out in to space, and the <strong>core collapses</strong>. Any elements heavier than iron are formed in supernovas. If the remaining core mass is greater than 1.44M☉, protons and electrons combine to form neutrons. This produces an extremely small, dense <strong>neutron star</strong>. If the remaining core mass is greater than 3M☉, the gravitational forces are so strong that the escape velocity of the core is greater than the speed of light. This is a <strong>black hole</strong>, which even photons cannot escape.</span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">Electromagnetic radiation from stars</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Energy levels of electrons</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Electrons bound to an atom can only exist in certain <strong>discrete energy levels</strong>. The electrons cannot have an energy value that is between two levels. Each element has its own set of energy levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">When an electron moves from a lower energy state to a higher energy state, it is &lsquo;excited&rsquo;. This requires the input of external energy e.g. heat, absorption of a photon. When an electron is de- excited, it moves towards the ground state. It releases energy in the form of a photon with a specific wavelength. Electrons can only be excited to the other discrete energy levels for that element.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">All energy level values are <strong>negative</strong>, with the ground state being the most negative. An electron that is completely free from an atom has energy equal to 0. This negative sign is used to represent the <strong>energy required </strong>to be inputted to remove the electron from the atom.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Spectra definitions</u></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Emission line spectra &ndash; each element produces a <strong>unique </strong>emission line spectrum because of the unique set of energy levels associated with its electrons. It appears as a series of coloured lines on a black background</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Continuous line spectra &ndash; <strong>all visible wavelengths </strong>of light are They are produced by atoms of solid heated metals.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Absorption line spectra &ndash; a series of <strong>dark spectral lines </strong>against the background of the continuous spectrum, with each line corresponding to a wavelength of light used to excite atoms of that element. The dark lines are at the same wavelengths as the coloured lines produced when the atoms are de-excited.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Emission spectral lines</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">When an electron is de-excited, it <strong>releases energy </strong>as a <strong>photon </strong>with a specific wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by the formula E = hc/&lambda;, where h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, and &lambda; is the wavelength of the photon. The energy released is the difference between the initial energy level of the electron, and the final energy level of the photon. This means that transitions between different energy levels produce photons with different wavelengths.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">As each element has a unique set of discrete energy levels, the <strong>wavelengths of light </strong>produced by the de-exciting of electrons are <strong>different for each element</strong>. Spectroscopy is the technique used to identify elements based on the wavelengths of light emitted when atoms in a gas are exited.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The characteristic emission line spectrum is produced &ndash; the spectral line is black, apart from emission line spectra at specific wavelengths.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Diffraction gratings</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Diffraction gratings are components with <strong>regularly spaced slits </strong>that can diffract light. Different colours of light have different wavelengths, and so will be diffracted at <strong>different angles</strong>. The equation</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝑑𝑑𝑛𝑛</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Can be used to determine the wavelength of the light, where d is the diffraction slit separation,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">𝑑𝑑 is the angle of diffraction, and n is the order of maxima.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Wien&rsquo;s displacement law</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The <strong>surface temperature </strong>of a star affects its colour. At any temperature above 0K, objects emit electromagnetic radiation of varying wavelength and intensity. Stars can be modelled as <strong>idealised black bodies </strong>that emit radiation across a range of wavelengths, with a <strong>peak </strong>in intensity at a specific wavelength, corresponding to the colour of the star.<strong><br />Wien&rsquo;s law </strong>is used to relate the temperature of the star with the peak wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the star. It states that <em>the black body radiation curve for different temperatures peaks at a wavelength inversely proportional to the temperature of the object.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Stefan&rsquo;s law</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Stefan&rsquo;s law </strong>is used to relate the temperature of a star with its luminosity, L. The luminosity is the <strong>radiant power output </strong>of the star, and is also proportional to the <strong>surface area </strong>of the star. It states that <em>for a black body, the total radiant heat energy emitted from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">If the colour, and hence peak wavelength of the star is known, then Wein&rsquo;s law can be used to calculate the absolute temperature of the star. If the luminosity is also known, then the radius of the star can be determined.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In exams, it is important to remember that these temperatures must be the <strong>absolute values</strong>, measured in Kelvin. Often the temperatures will be given in Centigrade to try and catch you out, so don&rsquo;t forget to convert them.</span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">Cosmological Distances and Measurements</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Distances</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">When considering the distances between planets and stars, <strong>different measurement units </strong>are used, as a metre is very small compared to these distances.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">1 Astronomical Unit (AU) = 1.5 x10<sup>11</sup>m &ndash; It is the <strong>average distance </strong>from the Earth to the sun, and is mostly used to express the distance of planets from the sun.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">1 Light year (ly) is the distance <strong>light travels </strong>in <strong>one year</strong>. It is given using the speed of light x time of 1 year (in seconds) = 9.46 x 10<sup>15</sup>m &ndash; It is used to express the distances to stars and other galaxies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Angles can be measured in units of <strong>arcminutes </strong>and <strong>arcseconds</strong>, for angles which are only a small fraction of a degree. In one degree there are 60 arcminutes, and 3600 arcseconds (so one arcsecond is 1/3600<sup>th</sup> of a degree.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">A Parsec (pc) is defined as the distance at which a radius of 1 AU subtends an angle of 1 arcsecond. In metres, 1 pc is 3.1x10<sup>16</sup>m, but it can also be written as 1 AU / arcsecond.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Stellar parallax</u></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Stellar parallax </strong>can be used to measure the distance to nearby stars. Parallax is the <strong>apparent shift </strong>in positon of an object against a backdrop of distance objects (that don&rsquo;t appear to move). It is accurate for distances of up to 100pc. Beyond this point, the angles involved are so small they are hard to accurately measure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Cosmological principle</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The <strong>cosmological principle </strong>defines the formation of the universe on a large scale. It states that <em>the universe is isotropic and homogenous, and the laws of physics are universal. </em>Isotropic means that the universe is the <strong>same in all directions </strong>to every observer, and it has no centre or edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Homogenous means that matter is <strong>uniformly distributed </strong>&ndash; for a large volume of the universe the density is the same.</span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">The Doppler Effect</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The Doppler Effect is the <strong>apparent shift </strong>in <strong>wavelength </strong>occurring when the source of the waves is moving. If the source is moving towards the detector then the wavelength appears to decrease. If the source is moving away from the detector, the wavelength appears in increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">It is important to note that the <strong>actual wavelength </strong>emitted by the source <strong>remains the same </strong>&ndash; it is only the wavelength that is <strong>received </strong>by the observer or detector that appears to have changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>The Doppler Effect and stars</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In star light, the Doppler Effect shifts the <strong>position </strong>of <strong>spectral lines</strong>. We can determine the absorption spectra of an element in the lab, and compare it to what is detected in the light from a star. The Doppler equation can be used to determine the <strong>relative speed </strong>of a star using the shift in wavelength from a hydrogen emission spectrum.</span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">Hubble&rsquo;s law and the expanding universe</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Hubble&rsquo;s law</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Hubble&rsquo;s law states that <em>the recessional velocity v of a galaxy is proportional to its distance from earth. </em>This means that the <strong>further away </strong>a star is from the Earth, the <strong>faster </strong>it is moving away from us. As a formula, 𝑉𝑉 = 𝐻𝐻<sub>0</sub>𝑑𝑑, where 𝐻𝐻<sub>0</sub> is the Hubble constant, 67.8 kms<sup>-1</sup>Mpc<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Model of an expanding universe</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Hubble&rsquo;s law provides key evidence for the model that states that the <strong>universe is expanding</strong>. Almost all light from distance galaxies is <strong>red shifted</strong>, showing that the galaxies are moving <strong>away from Earth</strong>. This suggests that the fabric of space and time is expanding, and any point in the universe is moving away from any other point.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Estimating the age of the universe</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Hubble&rsquo;s law can be used to estimate the age of the universe. If initially all points in the universe were together, then the distance of a galaxy from Earth, and its speed, are related to the time taken for the galaxy to reach this distance away from Earth. The time is given by d/v, which is equal to 1/H0, with the Hubble constant measured in seconds. It is difficult to get an accurate measurement for this value, but it is approximately 14 billion years.</span></p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">The Big Bang theory</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u></u>The Big Bang theory attempts to describe the origins and development of the early universe. All objects were initially <strong>contained in a singularity</strong>, which suddenly expanded outwards. The universe has not stopped expanding since then.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Evidence for the Big Bang theory</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">There are 2 key pieces of evidence to support the Big Bang theory. Hubble&rsquo;s Law shows the universe is expanding, through the red shift of light from distant galaxies. There is also <strong>microwave background radiation</strong>. Scientists were first measuring the radiation in space, and found a constant interference. There was no justification for this except the Big Bang theory.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Originally there were <strong>high energy gamma photons</strong>, but as the universe expanded, the <strong>wavelength </strong>of these photons was <strong>stretched </strong>into the <strong>microwave region </strong>&ndash; this provides a constant signal now. However this theory is not reliable because there is no experimental evidence &ndash; we can&rsquo;t recreate the initial conditions of the Big Bang.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>The evolution of the universe</u></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">The Big Bang: Time and space are created; the universe is a dense, hot</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">10<sup>-35</sup> s: The universe expands rapidly, in a period of incredible acceleration known as &ldquo;inflation&rdquo;. There is no matter, only high energy gamma photons and electromagnetic</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">10<sup>-6</sup> s: The first fundamental particles gain mass. The mechanism behind this is not fully understood but it involves the Higgs</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">10<sup>-3</sup> s: Most of the mass is created using pair The first hadrons come from quarks.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">1s: Production of mass is halted.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">100s: Protons and neutrons fuse to form deuterium, helium, lithium and beryllium nuclei, but nothing Rapid expansion continues. 25% of matter is helium nuclei.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">380 thousand years: It is now cool enough for the first atoms to</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">30 million years: The first stars form, and fusion creates heavier</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">200 million years: Our galaxy forms as gravitational forces pull together clouds of hydrogen and existing</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">9 billion years: The solar system forms by a nebula from a supernova. This is followed by the formation of our sun, and then the Earth almost 1billion years later.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">11 billion years: Primitive life begins on</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">7 billion years: The first modern humans evolve.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><u>Current theories on the universe</u></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">We only understand 5% of our universe. It is expanding at an <strong>increasing rate</strong>, but this acceleration is not fully understood. <strong>Dark Energy </strong>is a hypothetical form which fills all of space and accelerates expansion. It is used to explain the accelerating expansion, and should make up 68% of the total energy in the universe but so far experiments have not been able to find the form of the energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">During observations of galaxies, it was found that the velocity did not always behave as predicted. It was assumed that as an object moved away from the centre of a galaxy, its velocity would decrease (due to a lower gravitational field). This is what happens in smaller mass systems, like the solar system, or the moons of Jupiter. However, some observations suggested the mass is <strong>not concentrated </strong>in the <strong>centre </strong>of the galaxy, but instead is spread out. All of the observable mass in galaxies is concentrated in the centre, so there must be another type of matter we can&rsquo;t see, called &lsquo;<strong>Dark Matter</strong>&rsquo;. It should make up 27% of the mass in the universe. We don&rsquo;t know much about it, as it is not seen through telescopes and doesn&rsquo;t interact with light, but several particles have been suggested, such as gravitinos and axions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The future of the universe could be &lsquo;open&rsquo; &ndash; where it would <strong>continue expanding </strong>for all of time. Alternatively, it could be &lsquo;closed&rsquo; &ndash; at one point it will stop expanding, contract and <strong>collapse on itself</strong>. It may be &lsquo;flat&rsquo; &ndash; there might be an <strong>end to the expansion </strong>and the universe will remain a fixed size. The outcome that takes place depends on the <strong>density </strong>of the universe, but what will happen in our universe is not currently known.</span></p>
