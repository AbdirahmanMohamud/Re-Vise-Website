		  <h1>Local Area Networks and Wide Area Networks</h1>
  <h2>Local Area Networks</h2>
  <p>What is a network?</p>
  <p>A network can be defined as "two or more computers connected together to share information and resources". This can involve physical or wireless connections, or both</p>
  <p>What is a LAN?</p>
  <p>A LAN is a Local Area Network. It is a connection of computers and devices which are confined to a small geographical area. They are therefore relatively small and quite often the network infrastructure will be the property of the organisation.</p>
  <p>Top fact: Each device on a network is known as a node(e.g. computer, printer, etc)!</p>
  <p>Advantages of Local Area Networks</p>
  <p>They enable</p>
  <p>•	Digital communication between people</p>
  <p>•	The sharing of digital information</p>
  <p>•	The sharing of peripheral devices such as printers and scanners</p>
  <p>•	Computers to be updated with the latest software from a central point</p>
  <p>•	Distributed processing – the ability for a single program to be run simultaneously at various computers.</p>
  <p>Disadvantages of Local Area Networks</p>
  <p>•	They require a bit of ‘expertise’ to install and maintain a large network which can be costly.</p>
  <p>•	There are a number of security issues from unauthorised access to data.</p>
  <p>Measures to secure a network include</p>
  <p>•	Passwords – strong passwords use a range of character types</p>
  <p>•	Not allowing users to install software</p>
  <p>•	With wireless access, use encryption</p>
  <p>•	Changing passwords frequently</p>
  <h2>What is needed to make a LAN?</h2>
  <p>At least two computers (nodes), each having a NIC (Network Interface Card (either wired or wireless)).
The NICs convert the data signals from the nodes into data signals that can be transferred across the network. 
</p>
  <p>Data Transfer Media</p>
  <p>•	Wires</p>
  <p>•	Wireless Technology</p>
  <p>A hub or a Switch<p>
  <p>A hub is a device that connects nodes together. It makes all connected nodes act as a single segment. It is not considered intelligent as data packets are transmitted across the whole of the network. They are however cheap devices. For example USB hubs are often used in home network installations.</p>
  <p>A switch is also a device that connects nodes together. It is considered as an intelligent device as it can create and connect to different segments of the network which reduces network traffic because data packets are sent to the nodes or segment where they are needed rather than being broadcast to the whole network.</p>
  <p>A router</p>
  <p>Although not need to form a LAN, a router is a required if the LAN is to connect to the Internet. Routers manage the data packets enabling them to be sent between networks (e.g. over the internet).</p>
  <p>WAP - Wireless Access Point</p>
  <p>If the LAN is to make use of wireless technology it will require a 'Wireless Access Point'. Wireless technology has many advantages over wired networks</p>
  <p>•	There is no need to do building work</p>
  <p>•	You can add new node with ease</p>
  <p>•	The general public can access network / internet if allowed.</p>
  <p>But there are drawbacks. There can be performance issues as a result of signal interference. There can also be security issues if the data being transferred is not encrypted and is intercepted.</p>
  <h2>Types of Network in a Local Area Network</h2>
  <p>There are two types of LAN</p>
  <p>•	Peer-to-Peer</p>
  <p>•	Client Server</p>
  <p>In a peer-to-peer network, all computers have the same status. Data transfer may be very slow because of data collisions and shared processor power. They are only really suitable for small and low traffic networks and as a result are a very popular design for a home network</p>
  <p>In a client-server network, at least one computer is designated as a server which is usually required to be a high spec machine due to the jobs it will perform (serving the clients).</p>
  <p>A server will offer services such as software and data to client PCs (the client will request a service and the server will serve them). The server will also manage the traffic on the network, records what client users do and provide network security (clients will have to sign in and so their identification is known enabling certain rights to be given to certain people). Large networks may have many servers to handle the increased network demand.</p>
  <h2>Wide Area Networks(WANs)</h2>
  <p>What is a WAN?</p>
  <p>Wire area networks covers a large geographical area, they could be worldwide. Because of this, devices may be provided by telecoms companies like phone lines and satellites.</p>
  <p>What is the Interent?</p>
  <p>The Internet is the biggest WAN in the world. The internet is a massive network of networks. In other words, it is a ginormous collection of connected computers.</p>
  <p>Is the Internet and the World Wide Web the same?</p>
  <p>Although these two terms are used interchangeably, they are in fact very different. As explained above, the Internet is a ginormous collection of connected computers. The World Wide Web however, is just one application / use of the Internet. The WWW is the web of websites, providing the sharing of information. Other applications of the Internet are E-mail and FTP downloading.</p>
  <p>Web Hosting</p>
  <p>A host is a computer on a network which offers to serve users from another location, using the internet. Web hosting, in particular, is a service provided by various companies. These companies ‘host’ websites on their servers so that people around the world can access them 24/7. They will often charge a small fee for the rental of hard drive space, site security and back up services. It is of course possible for anyone (with a little knowhow) to host their own websites on their home PC, but for the price and risk, it is often more cost effective and less risky to pay for a specialist company to do this for you.</p>
  <p>Web Hosting and DNS</p>
  <p>In order to connect to various webhosts, so that we can access the websites we need, we use a system called DNS. In order to understand how DNS works we first need to understand a few other important acronyms.</p>
  <p>IP Address</p>
  <p>This means INTERNET PROTOCAL ADDRESS. It is a unique number given to every computer on the internet – no two computers can have the same address (e.g. 324.45.321.23). It’s just like a postal address – used to identify a house – no two houses have the same address! A device’s IP address will not necessarily remain the same each time it joins a network or goes on-line.</p>
  <p>ISP</p>
  <p>This means INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER.  This is simply the company who provide you with your internet connection. </p>a
  <p>URL</p>
  <p>This means UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR. This is simply a fancy name for a web address, such as “http://www.bbc.co.uk” or “http://www.google.com”.</p>
  <p>DNS</p>
  <p>This means DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM. This is the system used to find the computer which hosts the website you are looking for.</p>
  <p>How does DNS work?</p>
  <p>The Cloud</p>
  <p>'The Cloud' is a network of servers hosted on the internet which offer a range of services to store and process data. In particular, 'Cloud Computing' relates to online services provided in numerous</p>
  <p>Examples of cloud computing are:</p>
  <p>•	Office 365 / GoogleDocs</p>
  <p>•	Cloud Storage (GoogleDrive, OneDrive, DropBox)</p>
  <p>•	Netflix / Spotify</p>
  <p>Why would a company use such a service as Office365?</p>
  <p>•	They do not need to ‘buy’ and install the software.</p>
  <p>•	Any ‘connected’ computer can access the service.</p>
  <p>•	There is no need to upgrade the software.</p>
  <p>•	Collaboration can occur with multiple people working on the same document at once.</p>
  <p>•	Work is automatically saved / backed up.</p>
  <p> Virtual Networks </p>
  <p> We should by now be happy with the idea that LANs are a network of computers over a small geographical location and WANs are a network of computers over a wider geographical area. For both types of network, they are created through the connection of physical hardware.
A virtual network is one which uses software to subdivide a physical network (LAN or WAN) into smaller ones.</p>
<p>Virtual Networks and LANs (VLANs)</p>
<p>For a simple virtual network, software will re-divide a LOCAL AREA NETWORK into a series of smaller networks so that (for example) groups of workers can communicate and share information separately from other members of a company. Because it is software which enables the network to partitions (hardware remains as it was) it is knows as a VIRTUAL network.</p>
<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and WANs</p>
<p>Software can also re-divide a WIDE AREA NETWORK into a series of smaller networks so that (for example) groups of workers spread across the country / world can communicate and share information separately from other members of a company. As the internet is used by all, these networks will need added security and this is done through encryption. Due to this they are given the name PRIVATE NETWORKS, but of course, because they are created through the use of software, they are known as Virtual Private Networks (VPN).
